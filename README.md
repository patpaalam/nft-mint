NFT-Mint

This project is a practice on React JS and API calls with Axios. 

The app is a ble to connect with a mobile wallet. You can also min an NFT through an Ethereum Testnet (Goerli).

Dependancies used in this project: 

Axios for the API, 
React JS for the front end, 
React Bootstrap for styling, 
web3.js, 
and ethers. 

Full disclosure: 
I coded along with a Youtube tutorial (Net2Dev). 
I needed more practice with React JS and API calls.
