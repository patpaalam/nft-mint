Title: NFT-Mint

Description of project:

This project is a practice on React JS and API calls with Axios. 
The app is a ble to connect with a mobile wallet. You can also min an NFT through an Ethereum Testnet (Goerli).

Dependancies used in this project: 

Axios for the API, 
React JS for the front end, 
React Bootstrap for styling, 
web3.js, 
and ethers. 

Full disclosure: 

I coded along with a Youtube tutorial (Net2Dev). 
I needed more practice with React JS and API calls. 


Describe your project:

What data source did you use? 
I used the Etherscan data source.

What design decisions did you make?

I made an NFT Mint portal build on a Ether Testnet (Goerli). The upper part is where the user can connect to their decentralized wallet, and they can also mint an NFT from there. The lower part wuold show the NFTs the user currently owns. This is where the API calls are performed mostly. 

How did you approach the styling?

I used React Bootstrap for styling. 

Reflect on the process: 

What did you find challenging? 

Everything for me is still very challenging. I need to learn more about API calls as I realize how important they are, especially in web3 applications.

What did you enjoy? 

I enjoyed the whole process of learning from it. I get amazed at small triumphs I get by just making the website work. I enjoyed making an app that could communicate with Metamask and minting NFTs. Now I have the knowledge to make my own. I love NFTs and blockchain and defi, and learning about them. It is the reason why I began to learn coding.

What do you want to learn more about?

I need to practice more on API calls. I need to understand it more. I also need to learn to build with web3. Next for me, as a personal study, would be to learn how to build on the XRPL and Hedera ecosystem. I am also going to build more projects like this.
